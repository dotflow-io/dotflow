With Dotflow, you get a powerful and easy-to-use library designed to create execution pipelines without complication. Add tasks intuitively and control the entire process with just a few commands.

Our goal is to make task management faster and more secure, without overwhelming you with complexity. Simply instantiate the DotFlow class, add your tasks with the `add` method, and start execution with the `start` method.

Start with the basics [here](https://dotflow-io.github.io/dotflow/).
